### Problem Statement and Justification

People start their day with a coffee or a tea. In their rush morning, it is better if someone prepares a cup 
of coffee for them. And, in their work hours when they are exhausted, they would like to get a coffee. Not 
everyone is good at making coffee and if we go to a coffee shop, sometimes we cannot get coffee just like 
our preferrable taste. But also making coffee for them on their own is time consuming as well. No one 
nowadays like to waste their time in unproductive things like coffee making. But still some people need 
coffee for refreshment and to get some energy to continue their daily works. So, we would like to give 
them a solution in a form of a smart coffee making machine which can make coffee according to their 
own preference. What the user needs to do is just change the ingredient level according to their 
preference either using the interface on the machine or using a mobile application. This saves their time 
at the same time serve them with a delicious coffee to refresh them.

### Intended Market Segment
Since coffee is used by everyone our target customers are everyone. But if we want to be precise, we are 
targeting institutions with lot of workers. People used to get tired when they work continuously for hours. 
So, they need coffee often. Already there are coffee machines in workplaces. With the introduction of our 
machine those coffee machines can be replaced with our smart coffee machines. Also, there are a lot of 
households using coffee machines as well. So, this machine can be used for domestic purpose as well.

### Judgement of Applicability
We believe that this machine can be used globally. Because many people all over the world like to drink 
coffee. Therefore, this machine can bring a change not just locally but also globally.
